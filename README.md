This is very much a work-in-progress. This was originally meant to replace LoiRen, the renderer in [loitsu](https://github.com/apeltsi/loitsu), but the projects kinda got split off. Might still happen one day though.
Currently most settings are hard-coded this will change.

## Platforms
Actively tested on Windows, Linux (wayland) and macOS. Should work in x11 but no guarrantees currently :)

Web might happen one day
